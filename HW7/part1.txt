read the file from /foo/bar with Inode-based System:
-Use Master Block to find inode for "/" on disk
-Open "/", look for entry for "foo"
-Use the Master Block again to find inode for"/foo/" on disk
-Open "/foo/", look for entry for "/foo/bar"
-This entry gives the disk block number for the inode for "bar"
-Read the inode for "bar" into memory
-The inode says where first data block is on disk
-Read that block into memory to access the data in the file
